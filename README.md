# Super Elf 32Kb Ram and Rom Expander Card
  This card has 32kB of usuable ram at 0000h with an optional 32kB of EPROM or EEPROM at 8000h but address can be swapped by using 2 jumpers.
  It also includes a Bit Bang interface at 1200 baud with selectable inverted or non inverted EF2/EF3 signals.
  The card has the 44 pin edge connector but the 50 pin connector can be used if required.

  Optionally, it can also be used in conjunction with the Super Elf Hex Loader by stacking them via the onboard 50 pin connector

  Thanks to Andrew Wasson - https://github.com/awasson and David Madole - https://github.com/dmadole for their input towards the design.
